### What I learned

Right now I am learning about Frontend Mentor, Git and Github. Im also trying to make my CSS more structured with custom properties, utility classes and so on. I learned about all of the above mentioned areas in this project. If somebody sees this, I would appreciate some feedback on my commits and on my structuring of the style.css file. Of couse any help and feedback, regardless of what about, is appreciated.

### Continued development

I would first and foremost like to become more structured in my CSS. I believe that is my first priority.
